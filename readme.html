    <title>FSBV, Foreign Structures By Value
    </title>
    </head>
<p>Call foreign functions when one or more
  arguments and/or the return value are structures.
  In CFFI and most Lisp foreign interfaces, structures must be passed
  by reference, that is, as pointers.  FSBV permits calling them by
  value.  It requires
  <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cffi/">CFFI</a>
  and <a href="http://sourceware.org/libffi/">libffi</a>.
  </p>
<p> For example, the complex type is defined in
 the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">GNU Scientific Library
(GSL)</a> as
<pre>
typedef struct
  {
    double dat[2];
  }
gsl_complex;
</pre>
<p>The function <code>gsl_complex_conjugate</code> takes and returns a
structure of this type by value,
<pre>
gsl_complex gsl_complex_conjugate (gsl_complex z);
</pre>
<p>If we define
<pre>
(fsbv:defcstruct complex
  (dat :double :count 2))
(defun complex-conjugate (complex-number)
  (cffi:with-foreign-objects ((argument 'complex))
    (setf (foreign-realpart argument) (realpart complex-number)
	  (foreign-imagpart argument) (imagpart complex-number))
    (let ((ans (foreign-funcall "gsl_complex_conjugate"
				complex argument complex)))
      (complex
       (foreign-realpart ans)
       (foreign-imagpart ans)))))
</pre>
using appropriately-defined macros <code>foreign-realpart</code>
and <code>foreign-imagpart</code>, then we can call this function
from Lisp: 
<pre>
(complex-conjugate #c(3.0d0 4.0d0))
#C(3.0 -4.0)
</pre>
<p>There are two macros for users: <code>fsbv:defcstruct</code>
  and <code>fsbv:foreign-funcall</code>; they have the same arugments
  as their CFFI counterparts.  If foreign-funcall specifies no
  structures by value in its list of arguments or return type, it
  expands as <code>cffi:foreign-funcall</code>.
